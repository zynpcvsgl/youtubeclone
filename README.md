# YouTube Clone With HTML and CSS 

This project is a simple **YouTube UI clone** made using HTML and CSS. If you're a beginner learning HTML and CSS, this project offers valuable practice. You can learn and apply concepts such as:

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Flexbox and Grid systems.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Using CSS media queries.
- **CSS Positioning**: Sticky, absolute, relative, and fixed positions.
- And much more!

I firmly believe the best way to learn coding is through practice. By regularly working on projects like this, you'll steadily improve and become a professional developer.
